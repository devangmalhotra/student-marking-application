After clicking continue, Excel will display the course name, student ID, the grades of four assignments, the midterm exam, and the final exam, as well as the final grade of each student based on the weights shown below on the sheet named “Grades Data”. Additionally, the program will also show the average grade of the glass, the standard deviation, the maximum grade, and the minimum grade. A histogram of the final grades will also be generated. A Word document containing the histogram, “Grades Data” report and a paragraph explaining the program will be automatically generated in this step. This Word document will be saved in the same folder the workbook is located in. Additionally, there is also a “Display Class Average” button, which quickly shows the class average through a message box.
